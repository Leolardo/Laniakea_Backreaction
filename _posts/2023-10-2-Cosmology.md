## 3D Corrections induced in Pantheon+ 

The relative corrections induced by our effective model on the luminosity distance of the [Pantheon+ Supernovae](https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease) Supernovae used for the determination of the Hubble constant: {% include Pplus3d.html %}

## 2D Corrections induced in Pantheon+ 
The relative corrections induced by our effective model on the luminosity distance of the Pantheon+ Supernovae used for the determination of the Hubble constant projected in the sky, as a function of RA and DEC. The size of the dots reflects their distance from the observer ![Pantheon+_RA_DEC](images/Sn1aH0_corr_Radec.png)

## 2D Corrections induced on Surface Brightness Fluctuations 
The relative corrections induced by our effective model on the luminosity distance of a sample of [Surface Brightness Fluctuations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac01e7)  projected in the sky, as a function of RA and DEC.
