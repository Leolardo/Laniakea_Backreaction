Our galaxy, the Milky Way, belongs to a supercluster of galaxies known as [*Laniakea*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-00384-7). The main goal of this project is to estimate its gravitational backreaction or, in other words, to understand how (if at all) the latter influences our Cosmological inference.  We propose a toy model where Laniakea is described as a triaxially expanding homogeneous ellipsoid, with constant expansion rate along the principal axes. To build the model we use the [CF4](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202245331) reconstruction of the peculiar velocity field in the local Universe, and the recently update definition of Laniakea [obtained from it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02339).
In this page you will find some of our results from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00215), and some supplementary material, including interactive plots, which did not fit there. I Hope you enjoy them!
