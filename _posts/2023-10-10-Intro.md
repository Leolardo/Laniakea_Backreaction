Our galaxy, the Milky Way, belongs to a supercluster of galaxies known as *Laniakea*, and the main goal of this project is to understand how (if at all) the latter influences our cosmological parameter estimation. In other words, we are interested in understanding whether Laniakea's gravitational backreaction does have an impact on light travelling to us from distant sources. In this page you will find some of our results from the paper arxiv.1234.5678 and supplementary material, including interactive plots. Hope you enjoy them!
