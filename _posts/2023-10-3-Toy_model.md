## Best fit Ellipsoid

The Ellipsoid which best fits Laniakea Surface: {% include BEstfit.html %}

## Radial Velocities
The reconstructed radial peculiar velocity field inside Laniakea, computed with respect to the centre of our best fit ellipsoid: {% include Lania_rad_v_data.html %}

## Theoretical prediction
The quadrupolar prediction for the radial peculiar velocity field inside Laniakea predicted by the triaxial anisotropic expansion: {% include Lania_rad_v_theory.html %}

## Residuals
The residuals, in units of standard deviations, between the reconstructed radial peculiar velocity field and the theoretical prediction for a constant dispersion of 170 km/s : {% include Lania_residuals.html %}
